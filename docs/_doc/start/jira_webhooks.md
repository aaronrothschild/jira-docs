Notifications are configured with webhooks and offer full JQL support. Configuration is restricted to Jira System Admins only. See [these instructions](#2-configuration) for install and configuration.

The following Jira event notifications are supported:

  - Issue created
  - Issue updated, including when an issue is reopened or resolved, or when the assignee is changed
  - Issue deleted when not yet resolved
  - Comments created, updated or deleted

If youâ€™d like to see support for additional events, [let us know](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general).
